#First, we'll need to install the necessary packages
!pip install transformers
!pip install torch

#Next, we'll import the required libraries

import torch
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification

#We'll also need to download the pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

#Now we can define a function to preprocess the text data and convert it to a format that BERT can understand

def preprocess(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors="pt")
    return inputs

#We'll also define a function to make predictions using the BERT model

def predict_sentiment(text):
    inputs = preprocess(text)
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    logits = outputs[0]
    probabilities = torch.softmax(logits, dim=1).tolist()[0]
    positive_prob = probabilities[1]
    negative_prob = probabilities[0]
    if positive_prob > negative_prob:
        return 'positive'
    else:
        return 'negative'

#Now we can use our model to classify some example movie reviews

text = "This movie was fantastic! The acting was superb and the story kept me engaged from beginning to end."
print(predict_sentiment(text))

text = "I really didn't enjoy this movie. The acting was wooden and the story was predictable."
print(predict_sentiment(text))

#The output of this code should be
positive
negative
