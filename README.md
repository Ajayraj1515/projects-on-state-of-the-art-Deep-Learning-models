# projects-on-state-of-the-art-Deep-Learning-models
There are three basic models with the each model i have prepared basic project by own with help of internet
1.First mini project
The goal of this project is to build a sentiment analysis model using BERT that can classify movie reviews as positive or negative.
2.Second mini project
The goal of this project is to build an image classification model using the ResNet-50 deep learning architecture. The model will be trained on a dataset of images, and will be able to classify new images into one of several categories.
3.Third mini project 
The goal of this project is to build a text generation model using GPT-3.
