#First, we'll need to install the necessary packages
!pip install torch torchvision

#Next, we'll import the required libraries
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#We'll also need to download the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes
train_dataset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transforms.ToTensor())
test_dataset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=transforms.ToTensor())

#Now we can define the ResNet-50 model

        out = self.resnet50(x)

#We'll also need to define a data loader to load the dataset

#Now we can define a function to train the model

            running_loss += loss.item()

#And finally, we can define a function to test the model

#Now we can train and test the model
model = ResNet50(num_classes=10)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

num_epochs = 10
train(model, optimizer, criterion, num_epochs)
test(model)

#The output of this code will show the training loss for each epoch, as well as the accuracy of the
model on the test images.

#This is just a simple example, but with some tweaks and optimizations, you can build much more sophisticated 
image classification models using ResNet-50 and other deep learning architectures. With a project like this, 
you can showcase your skills in deep learning and demonstrate your ability to work with real-world datasets.
